### To do:
- Miscellaneous HDWD testing
- Auto-start HarDWare Daemon on boot (service?)
- Further "reporting" testing (which scenarios will result in loss of data when internet is unreachable? The existing issues have been fixed and no further issues observed)
- Enable backoff interval (between collect cycles). Current backoff is equal to CollectInterval. (I.e., collect runs for $CollectInterval time and then pauses for $CollectInterval time)
- Improve dashboard display (I.e., custom number of results per page, multiple pages, auto-refresh page option)
- Create auto-install scripts for node/server. Installation is currently via manual copy/paste steps.
- Add RSSI column to dashboard
- Add ESSID column to dashboard
- Option to export reports
- Option to export KML (for mapping purposes)
- Enable node authentication (AuthorizedNodes table?)
- MAC blacklisting? (I.e., do not collect on certain AP/BSSIDs or Station MACs)
- Add in configurable WireGuard taskings (to enable remote tunneling/access node shell for follow-on tasks)

### Observed issues:
- GPS reporting.. 0.005 and empty lat/lon entries (haven't been able to reproduce, but it also has not happened again)

### Improve the demo slides/info sheets
